    <h1>
      Hi, I'm Sam!
    </h1>

    <p>
      I'm a junior at the University of Michigan majoring in Information Science (User Experience Design) and minoring in Creative Writing.
    </p>

    <p>As a writer, I love stories that have twists to them. My biggest inspirations are Jhumpa Lahiri and Stephen King. I love the open-endedness of prose writing! The ambiguity of starting with a blank page is very much one of the best things about writing.
    </p>

    <p>  I'm passionate about all things interdisciplinary! I'd love to combine my background in writing and communication with my experience with coding, UX Research, and designing with accessibility in mind.
    </p>
